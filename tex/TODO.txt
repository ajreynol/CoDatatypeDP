  * Perhaps the authors could give some details about the impact (if any) of
    the new procedure on the execution time of the benchmarks that could be
    solved already without datatypes, or say if there are instances in which
    using the new procedure fails but the old ones succeeded. I'm referring in
    particular to a sentence at the end of section 5 that says "the stronger
    decision procedures *almost completely subsume* the weaker ones in
    practice". What does this "almost completely" mean exactly?

  * One thing is to improved is that, whereas the theoretical description uses
    a mapping A to check the applicability of the (probably) two most important
    rules, in the implementation section a high-level description of how to
    implement the rules without constructing A is described. I would move that
    explanation the the theoretical part, explaining why A is necessary (it is
    necessary for the correctness proofs, I guess) and explaining in more
    detail which is the relationship between A and what is implemented in
    practice.

  * It would be nice if the authors made it clearer how the results of this
    paper follow on from the earlier work they generalize. In particular, I
    found it unclear how much of the previous procedure was reused or whether
    it was just used to guide the development of the new calculus.
