Comments:


Lines 23, 118, 124 (first row): There should be some spacing on both sides of
the vertical bar (|). See the authors' PDF.

Line 54: The four dots (....) are poorly spaced out. There should be the same
amount of space between all of them. See the authors' PDF.

Lines 177, 292, 309, 434, 509, and 546: In our PDF, we carefully distinguished
between an "end of example" symbol (a solid black square) and an "end of
proof" (or QED) symbol (an open square). Readers with a mathematics background
will find the use of an "end of proof" symbol at the end of an example
strange. Please revert to the solid black square, which Springer has allowed
in previous J. Automated Reasoning publications.

Lines 377 and 378: There is a spurious paragraph break not present in the
authors' PDF.

Lines 420, 504, and 543: The equal signs should be aligned column-wise.

Line 421: Remove spurious indentation (cf. authors' PDF).

Line 584: Avoid "M" alone on its line using ~ (in LaTeX) or by removing M
altogether (since it is redundant).

Below line 602/Figure 4:  The caption of Figure 4 should be placed beneath the 
figure, analogously to Figure 5.
