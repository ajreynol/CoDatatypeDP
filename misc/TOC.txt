Abstract

1. Introduction [JCB]

\paragraph{Related Work}

    * point to Barrett et al. for SMT datatypes
    * additional ones since then (e.g. strings?)
    * anything about codatatypes?
      * proof assistants like Agda, Coq, etc. have them
      * Dafny, Prolog-thingy

2. Theory of (Co)datatypes [JCB]

  * unlike datatypes, codatatypes are never empty

3. The Calculus [AJR]

  * SMT background

  * Rewriter
  * Actual calculus

  * Correctness

  * no "internal search"

4. The Theory Solver [AJR]

  * Strategies
  * Implementation
    * what is an SMT theory solver
    * cooperation with Nelson-Oppen / integration into SMT solver
    * "mu" stuff

  * Enumerator?
    * for model generation

5. Examples [JCB]

6. Experimental Results [JCB/AJR]

  * Constructed examples
  * Isabelle benchmarks

7. Conclusion [JCB]
