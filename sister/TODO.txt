TODO:

  * Since the Sister Conference Best Paper track typically attracts a large
    attendance and readership from outside the specialised area, the authors might
    consider to add a few pointers to literature that introduces or surveys the
    use of SMT solvers in AI.

KIND OF DONE:

  * Acronyms such as CAV and even CADE, J.ACM in the references should be spelled
    out.
    >>> J. ACM stands for Journal of the ACM. I see no point in expanding that.
    >> And we're not going to expand ACM if they themselves don't expand it.

DONE:

  * In section 3.4 I suggest to add a reference to the proofs.
