The writing makes the paper easily accessible by the general IJCAI audience.

Since the Sister Conference Best Paper track typically attracts a large
attendance and readership from outside the specialised area, the authors might
consider to add a few pointers to literature that introduces or surveys the
use of SMT solvers in AI.

Acronyms such as CAV and even CADE, J.ACM in the references should be spelled
out.

In section 3.4 I suggest to add a reference to the proofs.
